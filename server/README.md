# Backend

In order to build backend module you need to run 
`make` in `root/server` folder. You will get executable file `main`.

I have added customizable path to the config file, try to run `./main --help`.

In order to test all cases - run `make test`.

Example of action: http://51.250.98.212:8080/hello
